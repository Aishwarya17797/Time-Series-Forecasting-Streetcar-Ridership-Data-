# Time-Series-Forecasting-Streetcar-Ridership-Data-

This project forecasts ridership for the Cincinnati streetcar over the next five years (2024-2029) using advanced time series models.

**Models Employed:**

**ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**:A statistical model that analyzes past patterns and trends in ridership data.

**Prophet**: A Facebook-developed forecasting model known for its flexibility and interpretability.

**Focus on Accuracy:**

Rigorous validation techniques were employed to ensure the accuracy of the final forecasts.
The final model achieved a high level of accuracy, with a 93% success rate.

**Expected Outcomes:**

Provides a reliable forecast of Cincinnati streetcar ridership for the next five years.
Assists city planners and transportation authorities in making informed decisions about resource allocation and potential expansion.

**Data:**
The forecasting models were trained on historical ridership data for the Cincinnati streetcar. This data likely included:

Daily, weekly, or monthly ridership figures
Historical trends and seasonality patterns
External factors influencing ridership (e.g., special events, weather)

**Disclaimer:**
Forecasts are inherently uncertain and may be affected by unforeseen events.

**Future Work:**
Continuously monitor ridership data and update the model to maintain accuracy.
Explore incorporating additional data sources, such as weather forecasts or planned construction projects.
Develop scenario planning to assess the impact of potential changes on ridership.

This project provides valuable insights for optimizing Cincinnati's streetcar system. Feel free to reach out for further details!
